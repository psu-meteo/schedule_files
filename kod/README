KOD campaign files are for special events on the kodiak radar which override the normal monthly schedule.
The campaign files must use the new priority and duration syntax in order to work correctly.

Note:
Because KOD is multi-channel operational, care should be taken to ensure all channels are running the same
pulse sequence at any given time.

campaign file events should be scheduled for all active channels with matching durations to ensure a common
pulse sequence is used on all channels, to avoid mismatched TR windows across channels.


To turn off a channel for a specific period of time, set the controlprogram to noopscan for that channel.
